A frontend to HAL's power features for KDE.
Supports screen brightness, battery level, plugged/unplugged notices, laptop lid closing actions
Original specification at https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuPowerManagement

TODO
    - In the KDE 3 version we had to keep polling HAL rather than listening for signals because the Python DBUS bindings
      don't have Qt mainloop integration, this can and should be fixed for KDE 4
    - Should also handle UPS and bluetooth batteries
    - Handle global keyindings, brightness up/down etc
    - It doesn't use solid, Thomas Gillespie is working on a C++ replacement which will
    - pretty graphs of power usage, a la gnome-power-manager?  (could just start ksysguard)
